A trivial file transfer protocol serves the purpose of providing a simplified method of sharing data between machines that do not primarily offer file services to an open network. 
An example of a current case where such transfer is adopted is PXE network booting, which transfers some data to network booted clients using an implementation of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). 
One key difference between TFTP and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the lack of user authentication, meaning TFTP is generally only practical when access control to the service is provided by some other mechanism, such as access to the network on which it operates. 
Who or what can connect to a TFTP service is determined by the ability to connect a device to that network. A LAN in a controlled environment or a series of directly connected devices with no public interfaces can be candidates for TFTP applications.
The TFTP protocol, as prescribed in RFC 783 using a client-server paradigm, is described as operating over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Although transport over UDP is not mandatory, it means that the reliability of more feature complete protocols such as TCP is not assumed to be present, and this is addressed in the TFTP design. Two components of the protocol go towards reliability; packet sequence is tracked via a block number, and packets not acknowledged as received are resent until they could reasonably be expected to be acknowledged, in the absence of a frustrating factor such as a network fault.
